# The PHP Language
Here we learn PHP, starting from scratch and go on to advanced concepts like Design Patterns, SOLID and TDD.

We concentrate on the language itself here, with the minimum of environment-specific notes.

# Our approach is a little different !
We are going to learn PHP by **examples** and **fun projects**.
