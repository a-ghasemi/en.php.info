### A Little HTML
I know that we want to learn about PHP, and PHP is a back-end skill. But how should we know what back-end exactly means without understanding front-end meaning?!

We will learn a little front-end to make body to our code, too. You have to show a simple wireframed UI (User Interface), then the front-end designer or developer will change its face with same functionality.
