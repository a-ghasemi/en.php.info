## The Mission
Drawing your thinking, before starting to design them has two major prons.
First you can share your mind, to get feedbacks and refine them. Second, it helps you to prepair your brain for fast design.

I am thinking about a profile page, containing a picture, with name and some details. And after all, a list of some completed projects.

Let's googling about free online tools that we need, this time a tool to design mockups. I designed the mockup that can find at https://wireframe.cc/ulqVo5

## HTML Begins!
HTML is a script language that convalved with website. Everytime we are talking about client side of webpages, we are talking about HTML. Browsers know HTML, and can render it to visualize the designer's mind.

### HTML Tag
HTML uses tags. Three major tags of HTML are:
* html
* head
* body

Tags are the biggest piece of HTML language.
